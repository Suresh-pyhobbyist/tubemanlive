## 🚀 Let's Get This Party Started\!

Ready to supercharge your live streams? Here’s how to get TubeManLive up and running:

Since you're using TubeManLive, the Chrome version being referred to is the one that TubeManLive interacts with.

You're using **Chrome version 137.0.7151.70** with TubeManLive.
Understood! So you're using a specific Chrome version for your testing.

Here's what you'll need, keeping it simple:

---

### 📋 What You'll Need

* **Python 3.x**: Get it from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **Google Chrome Browser**: You need Chrome installed. Download it from [google.com/chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
    * **I'm using Chrome version 137.0.7151.70.**
* **ChromeDriver**: Since you're using Chrome version **137.0.7151.70**, you'll need the matching ChromeDriver.
    * If you have **Selenium 4.6 or newer**, it should handle downloading the correct driver for you automatically.
    * Otherwise, you'll need to manually download ChromeDriver version 137.0.7151.70 from [googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/).

### 📦 Quick Setup

1.  **Get the Code:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your_repo_url_here> # Don't forget to replace this with your actual repo URL!
    cd <your_project_folder_name>
    ```

2.  **Spin Up a Virtual Environment (Smart Move\!):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the Essentials:**
    Create a file named `requirements.txt` in your main project folder and paste this inside:

    ```
    Flask==2.3.3
    selenium==4.22.0
    webdriver-manager==4.0.1
    spacy==3.7.4
    nltk==3.8.1
    ```

    Now, run this command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **One-Time Downloads (Might Happen Automatically):**
    TubeManLive might download some language data the first time you run it. If it gets stuck, you can manually trigger it:

    ```bash
    # For NLTK's sentiment brain
    python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('vader_lexicon')"

    # For SpaCy's language model
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

5.  **Folder Structure Check:**
    Just make sure your project looks like this:

    ```
    your_project_folder/
    ├── app.py                  # This is the main brain!
    ├── templates/
    │   └── dashboard.html      # Your awesome dashboard lives here
    └── static/
        ├── css/                # For future styling magic
        └── js/                 # For future interactive wizardry
    ```

    Make sure you've got the `dashboard.html` file (from our previous chat) inside that `templates/` folder\!

## 🚀 Fire It Up\!

1.  **Activate your virtual environment** (if you haven't already).
2.  **Launch TubeManLive:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
